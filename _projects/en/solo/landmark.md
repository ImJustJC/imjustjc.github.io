LandmARk was born in 2023 as an idea for my master's thesis project in Computer Engineering at University of Ja√©n. After a year and a half long development, I exhibited the work in september 2024 with a great reception from the audience at site and very satisfying results. Altough I wasn't entirely content with the final version, I'm really proud on what I ended up achieving and it really was worth the effort.

      My priority for the master's thesis was developing a game, and was lucky to be granted the chance even with some options already contemplated. At first it wasn't clear how to aim my ideas, but we ended up with an augmented reality proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augmented reality is kind of common today, so I was able to mold an idea that would satisfy the thesis requirements. While researching similar products, most end up only extending the real world with a virtual scene populated with objects, some of them linking the position with markers. This made me think at tabletop board games and I began to desing a board game using physical markers to link the virtual pieces positions; this is, a dual board where pieces are moved over a table while their actions take place virtually.

    <p>
      From this, the development started for a prototype where pieces could be placed and moved around a grid board using a physical marker. No doubt it was showy enough to convice the thesis graders, so the videogame itself took off as a 4X strategy game.

      The game supports Android devices and was developed with Unity and the Vuforia Engine library, handling augmented reality shenanigans. 3D models came from <a href="https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-medieval-hexagon">Kaykit's Medieval Hexagon Pack</a> and all 2D resources were obtained from <a href="https://kenney.nl/">Kenney's</a> collections.
