This review marks my first blog entry. Will it go smooth? Surely not, but I've found myself motivated to just write my thoughts about what I play. This feeling just aligned with me wrapping up Blue Prince, a game with many ins and outs to talk about.

<h1>The mysterious Mt. Holly</h1>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1.3em">
    <blockquote style="flex-grow: 1;" class="justified">
        I, Herbert S. Sinclair, of the Mount Holly Estate at Reddington, do publish, and declare this instrument, my last will and testament, and hereby revoke all wills and codicils heretofore made by me.
    </blockquote>
    <img style="float: right; padding-left: 1em; width: 60vw; max-width: 650px;" src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/mthollyestate.jpg" />
</div>

As his final will, Baron Sinclair bequeaths Mount Holly Estate to his grandniece, Simon P. Jones. Alongside this arrangement, he establishes a challenge to prove the heir of Sinclair worthy: found and prove the existence of Room 46 in his forty five room estate. A few days later, Simon arrives at Mount Holly to begin his incursion in the enigmatic estate.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 1.3em">
    <img style="width: 48.5%;" src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/day1.jpg" />
    <img style="width: 48.5%;" src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/entrance.jpg" />
</div>

Upon stepping into the entrance hall, one of Herbert's last writings lies on the central table, intended for the newcomer Simon. It makes it clear that this adventure will span days or even weeks, as the mansion may seem <strong>different upon returning the next morning</strong>. Additionally, it establishes several rules that prohibit keeping material findings between days and staying overnight inside the estate. With this information, the game's <em>rogue-lite</em> approach is presented, but what makes each run unique?

<h2>To build a conundrum</h2>

The mansion's blueprint is also present, dividing the property into a 5 by 9 grid of empty squares except for two: the entrance, located in the south-central part of the mansion, and the <strong>antechamber</strong>, located in the north-central part. Only from the antechamber can the desired room 46 be accessed. This blueprint also shows the player's possessions and general information about the current run and the overall progress of the game.

<img style="width: 100%;" src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/blueprint.jpg" />

<div style="margin-bottom: 1.3em">
    <img style="float: right; padding-left: 1em; width: 50vw; max-width: 600px;" src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/drafting.jpg" />
    With an empty mansion ahead, it's up to the player to create the layout of the rooms. When attempting to traverse any door that leads to an empty square, a random room selection process begins, offering three options with randomly chosen rooms. This is where the central axis of all runs appears and the possibilities expand to an apparently no end: day by day, this mansion will be completely different from previous instances; sometimes, even with different rooms that may take days to see again. Depending on this randomness and the decisions made while exploring the mansion, its structure and the goals that can be achieved will be established. Individually, each room is constant and will maintain its attributes, such as the number of exits, effects, and interior distribution. As with all <em>rogue-lite</em> games, the first runs may not go very far due to the lack of experience in strategy when placing exits to counteract the randomness, or simply because of trying to explore the dozens of options that the system continually offers (the most interesting rooms usually have a high draft cost or include few exits that can end up blocking the possibility of advancing).
</div>

<h1>Into the ever changing estate</h1>

The goal is clear from the moment the game starts: reach the antechamber and enter room 46 by drafting rooms with exits aligned towards the north. This will not always be possible in a direct way due to the random nature of the game, as rooms are offered with all kinds of combinations (from dead ends to corridors with doors in all four cardinal directions). While on one day you may reach high levels of the estate, on other days you may be limited to the initial section if luck is not on your side.

Even with a global goal in mind, you will have to advance with caution, as each day the player has a <strong>limited amount of resources</strong>. The most important resource and the one that must be precisely controlled is the <strong>number of steps</strong>, consumed when crossing any door and accessing a different room. It is important to consider that one step is consumed every time a door is crossed, whether visiting new rooms or backtracking to previously visited locations; failing to control step consumption will make days much less productive and may prevent you from reaching higher levels.

<h2>Not all that glitters is gold</h2>

When starting the adventure, one of the rules established was the prohibition of keeping resources and objects from one day to the next. Throughout the estate, three basic resources are distributed that will be necessary during exploration: gold coins that can be exchanged for other objects; keys to open locked doors or chests; and gems used as payment to generate the rarest and most useful rooms.

<figure style="margin: 0 0 1.3em 0">
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/storeroom.jpg" />
    <figcaption>
        <p>Rooms like <em>Storeroom</em> grant a gem, a key and a coin but no ramified exits.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

In addition to these resources, occasionally specific utility items may be found, such as shoes that reduce step consumption while exploring rooms, a hammer to break small chest locks and open them without using a key, or multiple special keys that influence the outcome of opening locked doors.

<blockquote class="quote-rule">
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em">While having resources and items distributed throughout the house as it expands, a need is induced to constantly check every nook and cranny thinking "What if there's something?". Although specific rooms always contain the same points where they appear, it's common to find coins or keys lying on the floor or behind furniture, and you end up going from one place to another with your head down looking at the floor.</p>

<p>It's not just a problem having you looking down all the time, even when you enter a room where you know there's an item, there's nothing to make it stand out from the rest of the room. In more than 20 hours of gameplay, I've had situations of not finding something that was right in front of me more times than I'd like to admit. Adding to the need to collect or interact with elements of the setting to solve certain puzzles, I'm not surprised that I've missed the opportunity more than once to complete something that, in principle, should be almost trivial.</p>

<h2>Inventive accommodations</h2>

Within this pseudo-random amalgamation, understanding the use of each mapped room will be the key point to have <em>better</em> runs and manage the resources that this home provides correctly. A common feature of each room is a color code that defines its primary purpose:

<ul>
    <li class="li-blue">Blue: blueprints with generic utilities o mandatory to progress.</li>
    <li class="li-purple">Purple: dormitories, boosting step recovery.</li>
    <li class="li-orange">Orange: hallways, without specific uses but higher branching.</li>
    <li class="li-red">Red: usually allows many branches but applies negative effects for the day.</li>
    <li class="li-green">Green: nature related rooms, higher in cost but with powerful effects.</li>
    <li class="li-yellow">Yellow: shop rooms to buy item with coins collected.</li>
</ul>

All rooms have a utility that may stand out more in certain situations or worsen the overall game situation. Among the entire set, after a short time of playing, there are two rooms that are much more striking in general for their utility at any time: <em>Billiard room</em> and <em>Parlor</em>. Both contain an individual puzzle that can be completed without external help (although certain documents explain their workings or offer advice) and offer a more or less known reward.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1.3em; gap: 1.5em">
    <div style="flex: 1 1 40%">
        <p>The billiard room features a dartboard that you can interact with. When you do, one of the panels will be highlighted, indicating the first step of the puzzle. I won't reveal the methodology in detail here, but this puzzle will quickly capture the attention of anyone interested in mathematical puzzles, as it has established rules and only changes the values, operators, and order to follow. As a reward, the target hides a prize in the form of common keys or a special key, which is why this room is of great interest.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1 1 60%">
        <img src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/billiard.jpg" />
    </div>
</div>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1.3em; gap: 1.5em">
    <div style="flex: 1 1 60%">
        <img src="/assets/images/games/blue_prince/parlor.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1 1 40%">
        <p>As soon as you enter the parlor, three boxes of different colors on pedestals and a phrase on their lid stand out. On a nearby table, a letter defines the rules of the puzzle: at least one box is true; at least one box is false; and only one box contains gems. By evaluating the phrase indicated on each box, you'll have to determine where the gems are, knowing these rules.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<blockquote class="quote-rule">
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em">
    Both the dart puzzle and the parlor are excellent proposals for smaller puzzles, designed to be solved in a moment. As you solve each one more and more times, their difficulty increases and they introduce more complex situations; in the case of the darts, they also add variations on the rules that were established at first, a complex situation to fit together at first. Repeating these rooms over and over again ends up being monotonous, as it is mandatory to get their rewards if you want a good enough run.
</p>

<h2>There is always another secret</h2>

We've already seen how each room proposes an interesting challenge, usually short but with attractive rewards to continue with the day. However, a classic in this genre, all of its content is covered by one or more large-scale mysteries that require several attempts to complete. The first obstacle you'll encounter relatively soon happens once you reach <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">the antechamber, as its accesses are blocked and it's not possible to enter simply by reaching the room</span>.

At the same time, simply playing and exploring more and more rooms makes certain elements of the setting stand out, especially <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">the pairs of paintings</span> that are found in almost all the rooms that can be generated in the estate. It is here where, after a variable amount of gameplay depending on the random factor of each run, it is revealed that they are not just decorations and, in fact, are part of a larger puzzle that will be solved over the course of multiple days.

<blockquote class="quote-rule">
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em">
    Something common to this games is providing that key moment, which lasts only a few seconds, but makes you feel a characteristic thrill when you realize that, indeed, you've been playing for hours ignoring something essential that could lead you to solve many of the questions you've been asking yourself. Despite only completing the basic ending of the game, I felt this several times during the adventure; all of them were equally spectacular, giving the impression that there were no secrets that would ever end.
</p>
<p>
    The following paragraph contains spoilers about one of the main mysteries presented by the game, and although not required for main progression, it's completely worth discovering it by yourself; it's an incredible idea with outstanding implementation that integrates perfectly with the rest of the game.
</p>
<p class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">
    There's no doubt that one of the elements that draws the most attention during a game is the presence of pairs of paintings in the visited rooms. At first, they show random drawings, without much relation between them. Upon finding a specific room, the study, it is revealed that the entire estate map contains 44 letters forming a message. Each letter corresponds to each draftable room place, without counting the antechamber, and is obtained through a pair of words that only differ in the letter in question. Then, everything connects: the pairs of paintings represent the two key words that give rise to a letter difference. As an example, the reception room always includes a painting with a diamond queen of spades and an ace of clubs, a <em>face</em> card and an <em>ace</em> card respectively, distanced by the letter <strong>F</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the genius behind the design of these mysteries, they have a significant flaw that can make them overly complicated: it's impossible to find solutions obtained, puzzle procedures, or even basic instructions in languages other than English. This also affects the background story shown by the game through writings, since having to read dozens of pages with large amounts of information and, on top of that, searching for any hint of a clue or solution, is a challenge that quickly becomes tedious for anyone with less fluency in the language.

<h1>Dawn of a new day</h1>

So far, Blue Prince fits perfectly into the puzzle genre and offers what is expected of it, but it incorporates a set of <em>rogue-lite</em> mechanics into the established formula. When a day ends, either voluntarily from the menu or forced by running out of steps, the estate returns to its original state without distributed rooms. At first, it doesn't seem to fit well with the mix of both genres since they are not directly related; what motivation is there to repeat the process of exploring over and over again? The answer the game provides is, without a doubt, promising, where not only do you have to stay alert to the many puzzles it includes and must understand a strategic system with which to build the map content to explore efficiently.

In particular, the idea behind focusing progress on dividing days is to extend the game's duration thanks to this drafting system, which is directly influenced by the player's decisions and randomness. Furthermore, regenerating the estate each time encourages visiting most rooms, either in search of something specific or for their structural or functional utility.

<h2>The thoughts of <em>Only one more</em> and <em>Can't progress anymore</em></h2>

Another common aspect of <em>rogue-lite</em> games are the two phrases that make up the title of this section. Breaking the gameplay experience into measurable and comparable fragments of time makes it easier for anyone to measure their game sessions and decide if they can afford another try. Of course, designing a progression and offering it all at once would make it expire in a short time, which is why barriers, secondary paths, or secrets that require multiple playthroughs are implemented. The room layout in Blue Prince addresses both of these issues: knowing the limited number of possible rooms in the estate and the player's curiosity and intention to explore, the average day would last between 30 minutes to an hour; similarly, the random factor of generating a room after a door is limited to only 3 options (there are ways to alter this process, but the base random factor still influences it).

Among those 3 options, multiple factors must be considered when choosing: Do I need the effect or content of the room to progress?; Does it have enough exits to continue exploring?; Can I afford to take the risk of its effect?. The most common situation that players quickly face is generating rooms without thinking about their exits, resulting in a blockage at the initial ranges of the mansion.

        <p>Sometimes, whether intentionally or due to randomness, it won't be possible to reach certain objectives because they are restricted to a subsection of the available space. In the image above, the entire northern half is inaccessible due to the selection of rooms, and thus prevents progress to the antechamber.</p>

<blockquote class="quote-rule">
<p style="margin-top: 1.3em">
    In theory, combining a puzzle game with <em>rogue-lite</em> mechanics doesn't quite harmonize, but it doesn't clash drastically either. During the first few hours of gameplay, it's a curious addition that even motivates you to continue exploring for new possibilities that didn't appear before. After a few days, the sense of satisfaction with the system starts to crumble when extremely negative situations arise. It's common to have a clear goal in mind, the solution to one of those big mysteries, and not being able to complete it because the necessary room doesn't appear for days.
</p>
<p>
    This has been my experience, with two peaks of despair when I was extremely close to solving the puzzles <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">of the laboratory</span> and <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">the water deposit</span>; both require <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">activating the energy in specific rooms from the boiler, but it only sends energy to adjacent rooms</span>. Out of my 21 hours of gameplay, with almost 40 days completed, I was only able to fulfill the conditions for those puzzles on one of them.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

Overall, Blue Prince has been a surprise, both good and bad, but after several days of reflection and reviewing the game, I can confidently say that the overall experience has been positive. Of course, the negative moments are very sharp and can greatly impact one's perception, but the game's ability to hide such dense mysteries in every corner and the accumulation of great ideas largely overshadow its clear errors. Simply tweaking the randomness factor, perhaps by providing alternatives to facilitate the search for specific rooms, I believe it would come close to being perfect gameplay-wise. A few days after its release, a couple of patches have already been published, addressing minor errors and making small adjustments to various mechanics.

I would definitely <strong>recommend Blue Prince to anyone interested in puzzle games</strong>, but with a big warning about the random factor that artificially extends the time needed to complete objectives. Good luck to anyone who wants to tackle the mystery of Mount Holly, it's definitely a unique experience! :)
