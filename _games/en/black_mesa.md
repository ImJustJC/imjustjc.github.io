Beyond a remake, the classic Half-Life reimagined and adapted.
</div>

<!--content-->

A month after my first review in this blog, I've been playing a few games, but Black Mesa got me off-guard. Even after playing the original Half-Life recently, all the improvements and adjustments make for a great experience.

<h1>Gordon Freeman, PhD. Theoretical Physics</h1>


<blockquote style="flex-grow: 1;" class="justified">
    Good morning, and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System.
</blockquote>

With a PhD. in Theoretical Physics under the arm, Gordon Freeman rides a tram destined to his workplace at Black Mesa Research Facility, located at New Mexico. Black Mesa facilities seem endless, housing labs, workshops and storerooms all around the rail system, making for a lengthy ride, with the loudspeakers announcing guidelines and rules of conduct for all workers.

        After some time, Freeman arrives at Sector C to his post and gets ready for a new experiment. These labs are kinda common: control rooms operated by security guards, conference rooms where scientists and <i>businessmen</i> debate, wardrobes with tons of lockers assigned to personnel, and a small kitchen equipped with cooking basics.

            While wandering around, Freeman is told to hurry towards his laboratory, where the experiment is about to start and he is required along his Hazardous Environment Suit (<b>H.E.V.</b>). Once supplied and right after arriving to the test room, the task assigned is simple: place a new sample in the spectrometer and ensure the system stability.

            At first, everything works under stable parameters, but all starts collapsing and the system reaches unstable levels, destroying the test lab and all machines, with a even greater influence to be revealed shortly. During the disaster, Freeman goes through exploding machinery, a collapsing room and some weird teleports to a remote and alien place.

This marks the beginning of the adventure of Gordon Freeman and Black Mesa, looking for an escape from the research facility and awaiting some help from the military. Shortly, it is revealed the true consequences from the failed experiment: alien creatures appeared all around and began messing everything up, leading to the only logic solution.

<h2>The crowbar-shotgun duality</h2>

Minutes after traversing the ruined facilities infested with headcrabs and zombified employees, one of the key moments arrives: acquiring <b>the crowbar</b>. There are few weapons more iconic in all videogame history, even with the crowbar not being particularly eye-catching at first. In the original Half-Life you could go through most parts of the game using the crowbar only, capable of a dozen hit per second and an indistinguishable hit sound effect.

<div style="margin-bottom: 1.3em; display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
    <blockquote class="quote-rule">
        <p style="margin-top: 1.3em">
            Black Mesa keeps almost everything the same, but for me it seems like some nerfs were in place: slower hits per second and lesser damage output overall. These doesn't really impact the weapon that much, since changes in the games physics and character movement are truly detrimental towards the weapon effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Half-Life felt unique thanks to the use of a modified Quake graphics engine, using a particular physics system where the player could abuse speed limits easily (hard to forget the good old <i>bunny hop</i>). With just a little practice, getting close to enemies and dodge everything thrown at you was pretty much trivial, and any enemy could be slain with just a few shots at close quarters. Sadly, Black Mesa balances heavily this movement and prevents many abuses, ending up with a slower pace that may content many players used to a modern approach.

Some time later, the games starts to grant the player some guns that greatly ease combat at earlier stages, beginning with a basic pistol from a security guard, followed by a submachine gun with a grenade launcher accessory. Those are both useful weapons, but they are promptly overpassed by the <b>pump-action shotgun</b> capable of single and double shots.


<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 1.3em; gap: 1.5em">

    <div style="flex: 1 1 60%">
        <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, the crowbar felt somewhat worse, but the shotgun got the opposite: it is worth the risk getting close to any enemy as it allows to oneshot almost anyone with a well aimed shot. Much later in the game you can get better weapons for most situations, although this shotgun is always a great alternative against many encounters.

<h2>New problems, same old solutions</h2>

Inside Black Mesa's many improvements, level design changes stand out the most when one expects simply a visual remake. It is really a great addition, Half-Life is about to turn 30, and both industry standards and player expectations are used to a totally different design than before, one that Black Mesa delivers. There's not only environment and encounter modifications, many puzzles are improved and even newly implemented with novel mechanics.

<blockquote class="quote-rule">
    <p style="margin-top: 1.3em">
        Without a doubt, going into a level with expectations from the original game and come to a totally new experience is a forte of Black Mesa. Used to merely visual remakes without much changes, getting updated content with such a good integration really motivated me to keep playing.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's true that almost all additions fit into the game's theme, but I faced issues with the level design a few times. In some play sessions I spent some time locked from progression just by not being able to solve the proposed puzzle, which ended up being a simple button interaction somewhat hidden around and didn't stand out from the scenario.

<h2>Frontier to a better world</h2>

Originally, this supposed remake was published via updates with new content as it was developed. Highlights from this stage focused on the playable part of <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">Xen</span>, with many years in development before being released. Luckily, the long wait was worth: the entire few chapters of the game were remade with many levels populated with vegetation, rich in color and new game mechanics.

            I started playing knowing Black Mesa as a remake with a few improvements. Just by passing over the earlier stages I was really surprised, but entering <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">Xen</span> is truly a unique moment with a great impact: this was something else. Everything in these last chapters is outstanding, a colorful world that feels alive with its own mechanic and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, it got a bit boring at the end due to the lengthy durations of the levels, in addition to a few bugs with the physics that broke cables used in puzzles and made me restart from checkpoint. Almost every puzzle here consist in connecting a cable to one or another socket, which quickly turns into a drag but at least is a simple enough mechanic to not harm the game greatly.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

During my first play hours, I though many times in dropping the game since I played Half-Life recently and there wasn't anything appealing apart from the visuals, which are great, but not enough for me personally. Fortunately, I kept up and it paid off as all the improvements showed up, giving the original a fresh look and feel while keeping its essence. Reaching <span class="quote-spoiler" tabindex="0">Xen and the Nihilant fight</span> was the cherry on top that made Black Mesa worth it playing.

Do I recommend Black Mesa? Totally, to anyone even if you aren't really into shooters or already played the original Half-Life or not (although you should have played it at least once honestly).
